Uses of Ternary Operator
> a small bit of syntax that tests a condition and returns one value/expression if it true, and another if it is false
> useful and can take up a lot less code than an if...else block (when we only have two choices chosen between via a true/false condition )

The pseudocode looks like this:

JS
<!--first way-->
condition ? run this code : run this code instead;

or

<!--second way-->
condition
? run this code <!--if condition is true this will be executed-->
: run this code instead; <!--if condition is false then this will be executed-->
